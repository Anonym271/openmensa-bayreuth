# openmensa-bayreuth
This is an [OpenMensa](https://openmensa.org/) parser for the University of Bayreuth. This branch is a python rewrite, the old version was written in C#.

Information are fetched from https://www.studentenwerk-oberfranken.de/essen/speiseplaene/bayreuth/hauptmensa.html

In theory, this parser is capable of parsing all canteens of the Studentenwerk Oberfranken. Howevery, currently I only parse the Hauptmensa and Frischraum of the University of Bayreuth because I don't know where the other canteens are located and how important they are. Help would be welcome.
